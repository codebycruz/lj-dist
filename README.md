# lj-dist

This repository serves to provide up to date builds of the LuaJIT static library and development headers for common platforms. They can then be used by something to link to and use lua, especially useful for creation of single executable applications. I made this for the [lpm](https://github.com/codebycruz/lpm) project.

## Supported Platforms

- [x] x86-64 Linux
- [x] Aarch64 Linux
- [x] x86-64 Windows

## Download

The latest builds are always available both as Github Actions artifacts, or in the latest release.
